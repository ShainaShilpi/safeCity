<p id="description">The main idea behind creating this community web application was to create awareness about any criminal activity happening around the users so that other community members can get an idea of severity of crime and crime intensity of a particular location. If the user is a victim of a crime then they can share their location with the community for help or they can also generate an SOS Emergency Alert to notify their contacts i.e. friends and family about the situation. If the user has witnessed any crime they can just share the details via uploading onsite captures or location which will give an insight to the other community members.</p>
